- 👋 Hi, I’m @sedrabaian
- 👀 I’m interested in in exploring the wonders of technology and the arts.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about AI and machine learning. It's like teaching a computer to think—how cool is that? I'm also brushing up on my cooking skills because who doesn't love a good homemade meal?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on tech-driven art projects. If you're passionate about blending creativity with code, let's create something magical together!
- 📫 How to reach me Feel free to drop me an email at bians@spu.edu or connect with me on LinkedIn. I promise my inbox is friendlier than a puppy at a park!
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
